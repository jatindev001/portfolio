          India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none
          as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the
          technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in
          the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a
          result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his
          time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own
          words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them. This
          ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more
          than ever of his bowlers especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a
          batsman for bowling depth, and led India to a long stay at No. 1 in
          Test rankings and a first-ever series win in Australia. He is well on
          his way to end up as India's most successful Test captain.
